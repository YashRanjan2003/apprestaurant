# Restaurant Platform Development Log

## Project Overview

The Restaurant Platform is a modern, mobile-first web application that allows customers to browse a restaurant's menu, place orders for pickup or delivery, and track their orders. The application is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase for the backend.

## Initial Project State

The project started with the goal of creating a comprehensive restaurant platform with the following core requirements:

- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Menu browsing and ordering capabilities
- Cart management
- Checkout process
- Order tracking
- Admin dashboard for restaurant management

The initial tech stack included:
- Next.js 15.1.7 for the frontend framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Context API for state management
- Supabase for database and authentication

#### 1.3 Cart System
- Implemented cart context for managing cart state across the application
- Added item addition, removal, and quantity adjustment
- Implemented real-time price calculations including:
  - Item total
  - GST (5%)
  - Platform fee
  - Dynamic delivery charge (free above â‚¹500)
- Set up cart persistence using localStorage

#### 1.4 Checkout Process
- Created checkout page with multiple sections:
  - Order type selection (Pickup/Delivery)
  - Delivery address input (for delivery orders)
  - Scheduled time selection with custom time option
  - Payment method selection
  - Order summary with price breakdown
- Implemented initial authentication requirements (later changed)

- Added help section with restaurant contact information

#### 1.6 Authentication
- Implemented user signup and login using Supabase
- Added phone number verification
- Made email registration optional
- Set up protected checkout route (later changed)

### Phase 2: Admin Dashboard

#### 2.1 Admin Dashboard Home
- Designed dashboard overview page with key metrics
- Added statistics, revenue overview, and store information sections
- Implemented recent orders and popular items widgets
- Enhanced layout for better desktop visualization

#### 2.2 Orders Management
- Created orders listing page with filtering capabilities
- Implemented detailed order view with expandable details
- Added status update functionality
- Enhanced desktop layout to show more information at once
- Implemented grid layout for order items, details, price breakdown, and status options

#### 2.3 User Management
- Designed users listing with search and filtering
- Added pagination for browsing through user records
- Implemented toggle between table and grid views
- Enhanced with additional user statistics (orders count, total spent)
- Optimized for desktop display with responsive layout

### Phase 3: Backend Integration

#### 3.1 Supabase Setup
- Created database tables for users, menu items, orders, etc.
- Set up authentication with Supabase
- Implemented row-level security policies
- Created storage buckets for menu item images
- Fixed storage policy issues with proper bucket permissions

#### 3.2 Image Handling
- Configured Next.js for handling images from Supabase storage
- Updated `next.config.js` to allow images from Supabase domain
- Implemented proper image display with optimized loading

## Major Changes and Improvements

### Authentication Flow Simplification
- **Original Implementation**: Required users to create accounts and log in before checkout
- **Change**: Removed the login/signup requirement in favor of collecting customer information directly at checkout
- **Rationale**: Simplify the user experience by reducing friction in the checkout process
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Removed authentication dependency from checkout page
  - Added customer information fields (name, phone, optional email) directly on checkout
  - Modified order storage structure to include customer information instead of user ID
  - Updated confirmation page to display customer details
  - Removed authentication redirects from the checkout flow

### UI Optimizations for Desktop
- **Original Implementation**: Mobile-first design with limited desktop optimizations
- **Change**: Enhanced layouts for better desktop viewing experience
- **Rationale**: Improve usability on larger screens while maintaining mobile compatibility
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Converted layouts to responsive grids for admin dashboard
  - Enhanced order details view with multi-column layout
  - Implemented toggleable display modes for user management
  - Added expanded information in desktop views

### Storage and Image Handling
- **Original Implementation**: Basic storage setup without proper permissions
- **Change**: Implemented comprehensive storage policies and image handling
- **Rationale**: Ensure proper image loading and storage security
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created SQL policies for the `menu-images` bucket
  - Fixed policy syntax for INSERT operations using `WITH CHECK` instead of `USING`
  - Updated Next.js configuration to properly handle Supabase image domains
  - Implemented remote patterns for secure image loading

## Technical Debt and Challenges

### Storage Permission Issues
- **Problem**: Images failed to load due to incorrect bucket permissions
- **Solution**: Created proper RLS policies for the storage bucket
- **Lesson Learned**: Storage permissions require different syntax than database RLS

### Authentication vs. Guest Checkout
- **Problem**: User authentication created friction in the checkout process
- **Solution**: Implemented guest checkout with direct customer information collection
- **Lesson Learned**: Balance security needs with user experience considerations

### Next.js Image Configuration
- **Problem**: 404 errors when loading images from Supabase
- **Solution**: Updated Next.js configuration with proper remote patterns
- **Lesson Learned**: External image domains require explicit configuration in Next.js

## Current State and Future Work

### Current State
The application now has a fully functional:
- Customer-facing ordering system with menu browsing, cart, and checkout
- Guest checkout that collects necessary customer information
- Order tracking system
- Admin dashboard for order and user management
- Proper image handling from Supabase storage

### Future Work
1. Implement real-time order notifications
2. Add actual payment gateway integration
3. Enhance menu management in the admin dashboard
4. Implement email notifications for order updates
5. Add analytics dashboard for business insights
6. Optimize performance with server-side rendering where appropriate
